# Python REST API Interaction Project

This project is centered on extensive interactions with REST APIs using Python. It spans a variety of operations including data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion. By undertaking this project, I aim to display my hands-on expertise in handling and validating API endpoints.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the API endpoints.
  
- **Data Creation**: Push new data entries to the server.
  
- **Data Update**: Modify existing data on the server.
  
- **Data Deletion**: Remove specific data entries from the server.

## API Source

The project relies on the endpoints provided by [GoRest](https://gorest.co.in). It's a platform offering a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data.
